# TOUR-GUITOUR

### What is TOUR-GUITOR?
TOUR-GUITOR is an web application that will connect tourists from around the world with tour guides of the places they wish to travel to. The web app will provide scheduling of the trip with best price while-else maintaing the enjoyment of the trip. Whether the tourists want family trip or adventurous trip, this app will cover all according to your preferrence. 

### How will it work?
Assume that you want to travel to Southeast Asia countries and you live in U.S, and you don't know much about Southeast Asia. But you don't have time to research on where to go since you just want to rest and relax because you are already stressed with your own work. Need not worry. This application will pick the trip plans for you based on where you are going, when you are going and how long you are staying with total amount of people joining you. It will then calculate the best price for the whole without sacrificing much of the enjoyment. Of course some additional questions will be asked to you to further optimize the satifaction of the whole trip. Not to say, we will also give you the tour guides options with reviews and feedbacks from previous tourists so that you don't need to worry about the trust issue. If you are still unsatisfied with the application pick, you can change our plan or start from scratch as you like.
